# Discord Egg Hunt

Hello and welcome to the Discord Egg Hunt bot! This bot will allow you to collect eggs hidden throughout your discord server,
and possibly in other servers that the bot partners with.

Want to follow the development? Hit the star button at the top of the page.

## Eggs

The bot will have many eggs for you to collect, all with their own special image when you find it. You will recieve special awards
upon collecting certain amount of eggs.

I plan to run this bot every year that I can, with new eggs appearing each year.

**If you own a server that is above 50 members or so, please contact Lgan#0494 if you would like to get your guild partnered with the bot. This event
will most probably increase activity in your server, as well as increase your server's members.**

**Got any egg suggestions? Post them in the iDevision #general channel and ping Lgan#0494 in the message, you will not have to design
the egg you suggest.**
